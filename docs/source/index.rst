General introduction
-----------------------

This project is developed using Django_, a web framework based on the
Python_ language.

Central to this work is also the reStructuredText_ markup language (for
short: reST from now on).

This is a method to sign a text achieving formatting effects, as 
writing charactes in bold, or creating a table, or an html link
to another document.

Here there is `a primer to reST`_.
